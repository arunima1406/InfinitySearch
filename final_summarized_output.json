Examples include safety-critical systems, industrial controls, and some automotive applications. * **Advantages:** Structured, easy to manage, low risk with stable requirements, and high reliability due to thorough testing. * **Disadvantages:** Inflexible to changes, late testing can lead to rework, limited customer involvement, and not ideal for complex or evolving projects. **Spiral Model:** * **Description:** A risk-driven, iterative model combining Waterfall and iterative elements. It incorporates risk assessment and prototyping at each stage. * **Suitability:** Well-suited for complex embedded systems with evolving requirements, hardware-software integration, real-time constraints, and resource limitations. * **Advantages:** Strong risk management, iterative development for refinement, early prototyping and validation, adaptability to changing requirements, and effective management of complexity."

            "This research proposes a novel approximate adder design, dubbed \"Error Reduced Carry Prediction (ERCP) and Constant Truncation,\" that significantly enhances computational accuracy while minimizing hardware. **Key Innovations:** * **Error-Reduced Carry Prediction (ERCP):** A new carry prediction technique is introduced, achieving up to a 75% reduction in prediction error rates compared to existing methods. This technique utilizes an \"AND-OR\" logic structure, requiring only two extra gates beyond a basic AND-based scheme, and reduces error rates to 12.3% for a 2-bit scenario. * **Constant Truncation with Error Reduction:** This method focuses on minimizing errors by setting the least significant bits (LSBs) to a constant value. Specifically, when no carry is present, the LSB is set to 1. When a carry is generated and propagated, all other bits are forced to 0 to reduce the error distance. This significantly reduces errors, for instance, from 211 to 84 in a given example. * **Approximate Full Adder Cells:** The design employs approximate full adder cells, particularly in the LSBs, by replacing XOR with OR gates and eliminating the carry-in from the carry calculation. This significantly reduces delay and power consumption. **Performance Improvements:** * **Accuracy:** Improves Normalized Mean Error Distance (NMED) by 91.4% and Mean Relative",

This significantly reduces delay and power consumption. **Performance Improvements:** * **Accuracy:** Improves Normalized Mean Error Distance (NMED) by 91.4% and Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED) by 98.9%. * **Efficiency:** Achieves substantial reductions in power, energy, and area-delay product (ADP) metrics by up to 99.4%. The figure of merit is reduced by 93.05%. * **Error Rate Comparison:** The proposed ERCP method achieves a 12.3% error rate, significantly lower than the 50% of a no-carry-prediction approach and the 25% of an AND-based carry prediction. **Trade-offs and Applications:** * A design parameter 'l' influences a trade-off: decreasing 'l' leads to more hardware but improves computational accuracy. * Validated in real-world applications: Demonstrated a 1.264 dB increase in Gaussian smoothing for digital image processing and a 3.78% improvement in K-means clustering for machine learning. In essence, the ERCP and Constant Truncation adder design offers a compelling balance between computational accuracy and hardware efficiency, making it suitable for applications where these factors are critical.",

Key achievements include selecting Spark 3x and Kafka as the primary stack, outlining a hybrid system design, and opting for the Lambda architecture due to its dual support for streaming and batch. The team has also compared Lambda vs. Kappa architectures and reviewed Spark-Kafka integration feasibility. Next steps involve integrating Kafka for ingestion, defining input sources for batch and streaming data, and confirming Spark 3x for structured streaming and batch. Challenges faced include balancing latency and throughput, evaluating fault tolerance for both processing modes, and ensuring scalability. The project utilizes Scala with Spark and Kafka, runs on Java JDK, and uses IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala plugin, SBT, and Docker Desktop. Open-source streaming datasets and public batch datasets are being used for data collection. The project is scheduled for August 2025."
